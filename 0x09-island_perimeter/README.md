# Function Description
The island_perimeter(grid) function takes a 2D list grid as input, where:

- 0 represents water
- 1 represents land
- Each cell is a square with a side length of 1
- Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally)
- The grid is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100
