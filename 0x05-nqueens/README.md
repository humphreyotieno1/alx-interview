The N-Queens problem is solved using a backtracking algorithm. The algorithm recursively searches for safe positions to place the queens on the chessboard. It starts with an empty board and attempts to place a queen in each row, checking if the position is safe by ensuring that no other queens can attack it. If a safe position is found, the algorithm moves on to the next row and repeats the process. If all queens are successfully placed on the board, a solution is found and printed. If no safe positions are found in a row, the algorithm backtracks to the previous row and explores other possibilities. This process continues until all possible configurations have been explored or a solution is found. The algorithm uses a combination of recursive functions, backtracking, and efficient checks to find all possible solutions to the N-Queens problem.
